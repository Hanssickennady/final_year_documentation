        <div class="text" id="intro">1. Introduction</div>
        <h4 class="sub-heading"><i>1.1 Scope of analysis</i></h4>
        <p>
            A chronic condition is a health condition or disease that is persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its
            effects or a disease that comes with time. The term "chronic" is often applied when the course of the
            disease lasts for more than three months. Common chronic diseases include diabetes, functional
            gastrointestinal disorder, eczema, arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Lyme
            disease, autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders and some viral diseases such as hepatitis C and acquired
            immunodeficiency syndrome. An illness which is lifelong because it ends in death is a terminal illness.</p>

        <p>63% of all deaths worldwide are from chronic conditions. Chronic diseases constitute a major cause of
            mortality, and the World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 38 million deaths a year to non-communicable
            diseases. In the United States approximately 40% of adults have at least two chronic conditions. Living with
            two or more chronic conditions is referred to as multimorbidity.</p>

        <p>While risk factors vary with age and gender, most of the common chronic diseases in the US are caused by
            dietary, lifestyle and metabolic risk factors that are also responsible for the resulting mortality.
            Therefore, these conditions might be prevented by behavioral changes, such as quitting smoking, adopting a
            healthy diet, and increasing physical activity. Social determinants are important risk factors for chronic
            diseases. Social factors, e.g., socioeconomic status, education level, and race/ethnicity, are a major cause
            for the disparities observed in the care of chronic disease. Lack of access and delay in receiving care
            result in worse outcomes for patients from minorities and underserved populations. Those barriers to medical
            care complicate patients monitoring and continuity in treatment.</p>

        <p>In the US, Minorities and low-income populations are less likely to access and receive preventive services
            necessary to detect conditions at an early stage. The majority of US health care and economic costs
            associated with medical conditions are for the costs of chronic diseases and conditions and associated
            health risk behaviors. Eighty-four percent of all health care spending in 2006 was for the 50% of the
            population who have one or more chronic medical conditions (CDC, 2014). There are several psychosocial risk
            and resistance factors among children with chronic illness and their family members. Adults with chronic
            illness were significantly more likely to report life dissatisfaction than those without chronic illness.
            Compared to their healthy peers, children with chronic illness have about a twofold increase in psychiatric
            disorders. Higher parental depression and other family stressors predicted more problems among patients. In
            addition, sibling problems along with the burden of illness on the family as a whole led to more
            psychological strain on the patients and their families.
        </p>
        <h4 class="sub-heading"><i>1.1.1 Impact on personal and social life</i></h4>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">I. Mental Health:</h4>
        <p>Specifically, the connection between loneliness and health and chronic condition has recently been
            highlighted. Some studies have shown that loneliness has detrimental health effects similar to that of
            smoking and obesity. One study found that feelings of isolation are associated with higher self-reporting of
            health as poor, and feelings of loneliness increased the likelihood of mental health disorders in
            individuals. The connection between chronic illness and loneliness is established, yet oftentimes ignored in
            treatment. One study for example found that a greater number of chronic illnesses per individual were
            associated with feelings of loneliness. Some of the possible reasons for this listed are an inability to
            maintain independence as well as the chronic illness being a source of stress for the individual. A study of
            loneliness in adults over age 65 found that low levels of loneliness as well as high levels of familial
            support were associated with better outcomes of multiple chronic conditions such as hypertension and
            diabetes.</p>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">II. Financial Cost:</h4>
        <p>People with chronic conditions pay more out-of-pocket; a study of the United States found that people spent
            $2,243 more on average. The financial burden can increase medication non adherence. In some countries, laws
            protect patients with chronic conditions from excessive financial responsibility; for example, as of 2008
            France limited copayments for those with chronic conditions, and Germany limits cost sharing to 1% of income
            versus 2% for the general public. Within the medical industrial complex, chronic illnesses can impact the
            relationship between pharmaceutical companies and people with chronic conditions. Life-saving drugs, or
            life-extending drugs, can be inflated for a profit. There is little regulation on the cost of chronic
            illness drugs, which suggests that abusing the lack of a drug cap can create a large market for drug
            revenue. Likewise, certain chronic conditions can last throughout one's lifetime and create pathways for
            pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of this.</p>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">III. Socioeconomic Class and Race:</h4>
        <p>Race is also allegedly implicated in chronic illness, although there may be many other factors involved.
            Racial minorities are 1.5-2 times more likely to have most chronic diseases than white individuals.
            Non-Hispanic blacks are 40% more likely to have high blood pressure that non-Hispanic whites, diagnosed
            diabetes is 77% higher among non-Hispanic blacks, and American Indians and Alaska Natives are 60% more
            likely to be obese than non-Hispanic whites. Some of this prevalence has been suggested to be in part from
            environmental racism. Flint, Michigan, for example, had high levels of lead poisoning in their drinkable
            water after waste was dumped into low-value housing areas. There are also higher rates of asthma in children
            who live in lower income areas due to an abundance of pollutants being released on a much larger scale in
            these areas.</p>
        <h4 class="sub-heading"><i>1.2 Overview</i></h4>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">1.2.1 Reports:</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li>Six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four in ten adults have two or more</li>
            <li>They are also leading drivers of the nation’s $4.1 trillion in annual health care costs.</li>
            <li><b>Heart</b> - Nothing kills more Americans than heart disease and stroke. More than 877,500 Americans
                die of heart disease or stroke every year—that’s one-third of all deaths. These diseases take an
                economic toll, as well, costing our health care system 216 billion dollar per year and causing $147
                billion in lost productivity on the job.</li>
            <li><b>Cancer</b> - Each year in the United States, more than 1.7 million people are diagnosed with cancer,
                and almost 600,000 die from it, making it the second leading cause of death. The cost of cancer care
                continues to rise and is expected to reach more than $240 billion by 2030.</li>
            <li><b>Arthritis</b> - Arthritis affects 58.5 million adults in the United States, which is about 1 in 4
                adults. It is a leading cause of work disability in the United States, one of the most common chronic
                conditions, and a common cause of chronic pain. The total cost attributable to arthritis and related
                conditions was about 303.5 billion dollar in 2013. Of this amount, nearly 140 billion dollar was for
                medical costs and $164 billion was for indirect costs associated with lost earnings.</li>
            <li><b>Alzheimer’s disease</b> - Alzheimer’s disease, a type of dementia, is an irreversible, progressive
                brain disease that affects about 5.7 million Americans, including 1 in 10 adults aged 65 and older. It
                is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause for those aged 65 or
                older. In 2020, the estimated cost of caring for and treating people with Alzheimer’s disease was 305
                billion dollar. By 2050, these costs are projected to be more than $1.1 trillion.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <h4 class="sub-heading">1.2.2 Reason behind why I took this Dataset:</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li>In this modern world on my view health and medical is more important to develop a community or nation
                economy So I give prioritize to medical industry and I like to analysis on medical data which may help
                me to understand about the people health condition.</li>
            <li>Now a days chronic diseases is the challenging for medical industry, So I thought that by doing analysis
                on that may help doctors to understand and predict their patients.</li>
            <li>If the person being healthy then it helps his personal and social life and also for a country growth.
            </li>
            <li>chronic diseases are usually not curable. That makes me attracts to choose this dataset</li>
        </ul> -->
        <h4 class="sub-heading"><i>1.3 Source of the Data</i></h4>
        <p>The dataset was taken from Centers for Disease Control and prevention government agency under U.S. Department
            of Health and Human Services . The dataset was updated on 30th January 2023. It is public license. It
            contains 1.19M observations and 34 features (YearStart, YearEnd, LocationAbbr, LocationDesc, DataSource,

                <span><b><i><u>Type 1 Diabetes: </u></i></b></span> <br> <br>
                <span>Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that causes the insulin producing beta cells in the
                    pancreas to be destroyed, preventing the body from being able to produce enough insulin. For this
                    reason, type 1 diabetes patients will be dependent on external sources of insulin throughout their
                    lifetime. People who have type 1 diabetes may also have nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains. Type 1
                    diabetes symptoms can develop in just a few weeks or months and can be severe. Type 1 diabetes
                    usually starts when you’re a child, teen, or young adult but can happen at any age.</span> <br><br>
                <span><b><i><u>Type 2 Diabetes: </u></i></b></span> <br> <br>
                <span>Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition where the body either resists the effects of insulin or
                    doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes symptoms often
                    take several years to develop. Some people don’t notice any symptoms at all. Type 2 diabetes usually
                    starts when you’re an adult, though more and more children and teens are developing it. Because
                    symptoms are hard to spot, it’s important to know the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Make sure to
                    visit your doctor if you have any of them.</span> <br><br>
                <span><b><i><u>Gestational Diabetes: </u></i></b></span> <br> <br>
                <span>Gestational diabetes is any change in blood sugar levels that is diagnosed for the first-time
                    during pregnancy, regardless if the condition continues after childbirth or not. Gestational
                    diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) usually doesn’t have any symptoms. If you’re pregnant, your
                    doctor should test you for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If needed, you
                    can make changes to protect your health and your baby’s health.</span>

                <ul class="bullet-point">
                    <li><b>coronary heart disease (CHD)</b> - It occurs when your heart muscle's blood supply is blocked
                        or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances (atheroma) in the coronary arteries. If a
                        coronary artery becomes completely blocked, it can cause a heart attack. This is a medical
                        emergency.</li>
                    <li><b>Stroke</b> - A stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to the
                        brain is disturbed. Like all organs, your brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients
                        to function properly. This is provided by the blood, so if your blood flow is restricted or
                        stopped, brain cells will begin to die. This can lead to brain damage and possibly death.</li>
                    <li><b>peripheral arterial disease</b> - Peripheral arterial disease, also known as peripheral
                        vascular disease, occurs when there is a blockage in the arteries to your limbs (usually your
                        legs). The most common symptom of peripheral arterial disease is pain in your legs when walking.
                        This is usually in one or both of your thighs, hips or calves. The pain can feel like cramp, a
                        dull pain or a sensation of heaviness in the muscles of your legs. It usually comes and goes and
                        gets worse during exercise that uses your legs, such as walking or climbing stairs.</li>
                    <li><b>aortic disease</b> - The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It carries blood from
                        your heart to the rest of your body. The most common type of aortic disease is aortic aneurysm,
                        which is where the wall of the aorta becomes weakened and bulges outwards. You will usually
                        experience pain in your chest, back or abdomen (tummy).</li>

            <li><b>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD):</b> <br> <br>
                <span>It is a common, preventable and treatable chronic lung disease which affects men and women
                    worldwide. Abnormalities in the small airways of the lungs lead to limitation of airflow in and out
                    of the lungs. Several processes cause the airways to become narrow. There may be destruction of
                    parts of the lung, mucus blocking the airways, and inflammation and swelling of the airway lining.
                    COPD is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema usually refers to destruction of
                    the tiny air sacs at the end of the airways in the lungs. Chronic bronchitis refers to a chronic
                    cough with the production of phlegm resulting from inflammation in the airways.</span> <br>
                <span>Common symptoms of COPD develop from mid-life onwards, including:</span>
                <ul class="bullet-point">
                    <li>breathlessness or difficulty breathing</li>

            <li><b>Asthma:</b> <br> <br>
                <span>Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can
                    make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and
                    shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major
                    problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.
                    Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time,
                    it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your

            <li><b>Alcohol:</b> <br> <br>
                <span>Alcoholism, also called alcohol use disorder, is using alcohol in excessive amounts and being
                    unable to control one’s use of alcohol. Someone who has an alcohol use disorder isn’t able to manage
                    their drinking. Alcohol use disorder may be characterized as mild, moderate or severe, and every
                    category has its own symptoms and side effects. Alcohol use disorder was previously broken into two
                    categories by the medical community: abuse and dependence. It’s now measured on a spectrum.
                    Depending on the number of criteria a person meets, they can be diagnosed as having a mild to severe
                    alcohol use disorder. Some of the alcoholic diagnosis criteria include having a craving to use
                    alcohol, drinking more than intended or continuing to use alcohol despite problems in relationships.
                    Research shows that alcohol use disorder often co-occurs with other mental health disorders,
                    including bipolar disorder and major depression.</span><br><br>
                <span>Alcoholism and alcohol abuse are serious problems in the U.S. In 2019, 14.5 million adults had
                    alcohol use disorder, with only 7.9% receiving treatment. Another 401,000 teens aged 12 to 17 had an
                    alcohol use disorder.</span><br>
                <span>The following risk factors contribute to alcohol use disorder:</span>
                <ul class="bullet-point">
                    <li>Drinking prior to age 15</li>
                    <li>Genetics and family history</li>

                    <li>Heavy alcohol use and binge drinking</li>
                </ul>
                <span>Alcoholism typically becomes a disease when:</span>
                <ul class="bullet-point">
                    <li>You try to stop and can’t.</li>
                    <li>You continue despite sometimes extremely adverse outcomes.</li>
                    <li>You have a physical dependence on alcohol and experience withdrawal if you try to stop.</li>
                </ul>
                <span>Alcoholism is considered a chronic disease for several reasons. It has some elements of
                    heritability, meaning there are genetic components that can run in families. Environmental factors
                    are also part of the equation. Consider diabetes, another chronic disease. Whether or not you
                    develop diabetes is based on a combination of your family’s genes and your personal lifestyle
                    choices, like diet and exercise. Alcoholism is similar. You may be genetically more predisposed to
                    developing alcoholism if you have a family member or ancestor who had an alcohol addiction. Growing
                    up in an environment where alcohol is prevalent contributes to this risk. The environmental risk
                    factors and genetics work together and determine the course of the disease. Like other chronic
                    diseases, alcoholism can be identified and diagnosed based on certain symptoms and can be managed
                    with professional treatment. Treatment options often include a combination of medications, therapy
                    and cognitive behavioural treatment in inpatient and outpatient settings. When alcoholism and other
                    chronic diseases aren’t being properly treated and managed, relapse is possible. While you can’t
                    necessarily cure diabetes, you can keep it under control with medications and lifestyle choices like
                    exercise and a healthy diet. If you stopped doing these things, your diabetes would be out of
                    control, and there would be adverse consequences.</span>

            <li><b>Tobacco:</b> <br> <br>
                <span>Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United
                    States. Every day in the United States, about 1,600 young people under age 18 try their first
                    cigarette, and nearly 200 end up smoking cigarettes daily.</span><br><br>
                <span>Cigarette smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body.
                    Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic
                    health conditions. The impact also extends beyond the person who smokes. For example, smoking during
                    pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth (being born too early) and sudden infant death
                    syndrome (SIDS). Second-hand smoke, which affects 58 million Americans who don’t smoke, also causes
                    stroke, lung cancer, and heart disease in adults. Children who are exposed to second-hand smoke are
                    at increased risk of SIDS, impaired lung function, acute respiratory infections, middle ear disease,
                    and more frequent and severe asthma attacks.</span><br><br>
                <span><b>Cancer:</b><br><br> Cigarette smoking causes several forms of cancer, including about 80% to
                    90% of lung cancer deaths. People who don’t smoke can also develop lung cancer, and those who are
                    exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work have a 20% to 30% higher risk of getting lung cancer
                    than those not exposed. Smoking also causes cancers of the voice box (larynx), mouth and throat,
                    esophagus, bladder, kidney, liver, pancreas, cervix, colon, rectum, and stomach, as well as a type
                    of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia. It can also interfere with cancer treatment,

                    (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking accounts for as many as 8 in 10
                    COPD-related deaths. If you have asthma, tobacco smoke can trigger an asthma attack or make an

                <span>Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney
                    function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in
                    your urine. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and
                    wastes to build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few
                    signs or symptoms. You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is
                    advanced. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage,
                    usually by controlling the cause. But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from
                    progressing. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without
                    artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.</span><br><br>
                <span>Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly.
                    Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems.
                    Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause : Nausea, Vomiting, Loss of
                    appetite, Fatigue and weakness, Sleep problems, Urinating more or less, Decreased mental sharpness,

        <h4 class="sub-heading"><i>3.1 Data Cleaning</i></h4>
        <p>Data cleaning or data preparation is an essential part of statistical analysis. In this part mostly we are
            checking the null values, inconsistency of data, and outliers. One of the biggest challenges when it comes
            to utilizing Machine Learning data is Data Cleaning. Although data cleaning may not be mentioned too often,
            it is very critical for the success of Machine Learning applications. This will help you to yield better
            results from your machine learning functions. Also, remove duplicate categorization from your data list and
            streamline your data. It is good to reduce the data you are handling. A downsized dataset can help you
            generate more accurate results. The main aim of Data Cleaning is to identify and remove errors & duplicate
            data, to create a reliable dataset. This improves the quality of the training data for analytics and enables
            accurate decision-making. Data cleansing is a time-consuming process and most data scientists spend an
            enormous amount of time enhancing the quality of the data. However, there are various methods to identify
            and classify data for data cleansing.</p>
        <p>The data set is an important asset in any data analysis and model-building process. Generally, 80% of the
            time data scientists are utilized in data cleaning and manipulation, whereas 20% of the time are utilized in
            analysis and modelling. ‘Data cleaning’ is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or
            inaccurate records from a recordset, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect,
            inaccurate, or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse
            data. To perform the data analytics properly we need a variety of data cleaning methods. Data cleaning
            depends on the type of data set. Data cleaning will help us to increase the accuracy of the model. The data
            cleaning and validation steps undertaken for any data science project are implemented using a data pipeline.
            Each stage in a data pipeline consumes input and produces output. The main advantage of the data pipeline is
            that each step is small, self-contained, and easier to check. Some data pipeline systems also allow you to
            resume the pipeline from the middle, thus, saving time. In this article, we will look at eight common steps
            in the data cleaning process, as mentioned below. </p>

        <div class="text" id="EDA">4. Exploratory Data Analysis</div>
        <h4 class="sub-heading"><i>4.1 Data Exploration</i></h4>
        <p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyse and investigate data sets and summarize
            their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to
            manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover
            patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.</p>
        <p>EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task and
            provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help
            determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Originally
            developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used
            method in the data discovery process today.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious
            errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find
            interesting relations among the variables.</p>
        <p>Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to
            any desired business outcomes and goals. EDA also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right
            questions. EDA can help answer questions about standard deviations, categorical variables, and confidence
            intervals. Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its features can then be used for more sophisticated
            data analysis or modelling, including machine learning.</p>
        <p>Specific statistical functions and techniques you can perform with EDA tools include:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li>Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical displays of high-dimensional
                data containing many variables.</li>
            <li>Univariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.</li>
            <li>Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess the relationship between each
                variable in the dataset and the target variable you’re looking at.</li>
            <li>Multivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the
                data.</li>
            <li>K-means Clustering is a clustering method in unsupervised learning where data points are assigned into K
                groups, i.e., the number of clusters, based on the distance from each group’s centroid. The data points
                closest to a particular centroid will be clustered under the same category. K-means Clustering is
                commonly used in market segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression.</li>
            <li>Predictive models, such as linear regression, use statistics and data to predict outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are four primary types of EDA:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li><b>Univariate non-graphical.</b> This is the simplest form of data analysis, where the data being
                analysed consists of just one variable. Since it’s a single variable, it doesn’t deal with causes or
                relationships. The main purpose of univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that
                exist within it.</li>
            <li><b>Univariate graphical.</b> Non-graphical methods don’t provide a full picture of the data. Graphical
                methods
                are therefore required. Common types of univariate graphics include: <ul class="bullet-point">
                    <li>Stem-and-leaf plots, which show all data values and the shape of the distribution.</li>
                    <li>Histograms, a bar plot in which each bar represents the frequency (count) or proportion
                        (count/total count) of cases for a range of values.</li>
                    <li>Box plots, which graphically depict the five-number summary of minimum, first quartile, median,
                        third quartile, and maximum.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Multivariate nongraphical:</b> Multivariate data arises from more than one variable. Multivariate
                non-graphical EDA techniques generally show the relationship between two or more variables of the data
                through cross-tabulation or statistics.</li>
            <li><b>Multivariate graphical:</b> Multivariate data uses graphics to display relationships between two or
                more sets of data. The most used graphic is a grouped bar plot or bar chart with each group representing
                one level of one of the variables and each bar within a group representing the levels of the other
                variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other common types of multivariate graphics include:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li>Scatter plot, which is used to plot data points on a horizontal and a vertical axis to show how much one
                variable is affected by another.</li>
            <li>Multivariate chart, which is a graphical representation of the relationships between factors and a
                response.</li>
            <li>Run chart, which is a line graph of data plotted over time.</li>
            <li>Bubble chart, which is a data visualization that displays multiple circles (bubbles) in a
                two-dimensional plot.</li>
            <li>Heat map, which is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by colour.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>So, we have to concentrate on people health and mortality</li>
            <li>These chronic diseases are very challenging to the medical field with the help of doctors and analysts,
                we can save many people’s lives and countries too</li>
            <li>After 10 years, 2033 from now, we have to overcome this disease like before we overcome fever and other
                historical diseases</li>
            <li>Everyone has the responsibility to do something for our nation and in my part, I’ll give my full efforts
                to improvise the medical field because without that infrastructure we personally or nationally can’t see
                growth and life. Major things that are happening around us are invisibly connected to the medical field
